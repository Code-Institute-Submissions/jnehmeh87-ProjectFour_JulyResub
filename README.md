# Portfolio Project 4 - Food Mood
## Purpose

Food Mood is a Django application for food lovers.

The users can read recipes, like and comment on them.

This application was created for the purpose of completing the Portfolio 4 for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course and is entirely fictional.
The project covers Full Stack framework with a user centric approach in mind.  A full list of technologies used can be found in the technologies section of this document.

Here is the live version of my project. [here](https://foodupmood.herokuapp.com/)

## User Experience (UX)
The user can chech the website for new recipes and see the likes and comments on each recipe to get a better review. The user can also login to be able to like recipes as well as comment on them. The user will be able to update their comments and delete them as well.
